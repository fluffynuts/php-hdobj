Hierachical Data Object in php with support for xml read/write

Last updated 2008-03-17

Obsolete and not really that useful now, this harkens from a time
when PHP was a truly dynamic language, when one could tack properties
onto objects willy-nilly. This made the code in this repo really convenient
for reading and writing heirachical data in a time when XML was still "cool".
