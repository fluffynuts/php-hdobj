<h3>Hierachical Data Object documentation</h3>
<div class="shead">What is this?</div>
<!--  <<< -->
<div class="section">
<p>
The Hierachical Data Object is just another container for your data, but it's
a relatively smart way to contain your data. Basically, the object can hold
any data, with any kind of parent-child relationship, and each child (or it's
member variables) can have attributes which are useful for handling the data
contained within them. The nicest thing about the HD Object is that it uses
XML for a transport -- meaning that not only can you load it from xml, but
you can also get it to dump out a representation of itself in XML format.
</p>
<p>
The HD Object uses the DOMIT library to acheive this XML transport -- but only
the xml-related functions are dependant on the DOMIT libraries. You can use
the HD Object without the XML references if you like. But generally, you want 
to use the XML functionality.
</p>
</div>
<!-- >>> -->
<div class="shead">But why?</div>
<!-- <<< -->
<div class="section">
<p>
I can hear you groaning from there -- why another layer on top of XML? Good
point. There's nothing at all wrong with the DOMIT libraries -- in fact, they
are really good. I just wanted to acheive a few goals:
</p>
My primary goal was to have a class which handled hierachical data, and
which had a way of transporting that data, or communicating that data, to 
another entity that had no concept of the class itself (at least, not in the
form you see it). Basically, I wanted a way to converse effectively and 
efficiently between a TCL network application and a PHP script. Both languages
offer the ability to communicate over TCP/IP, and I just wanted a good 
transport mechanism for that. Heck, that's one of the instances for which XML
was designed -- extensible data that describes itself! Isn't that a neat idea?!
So I set about creating a PHP class that could store and represent the data (in
XML format) and a mirror-image IncrTCL class that could do the same. The 
result is a working xml-based transport between a TCL socketed network 
application and a PHP script. Problem solved!
</p>
<p>
Apart from that, I found that working with my HD Object was a little more
intutitve than using the XML nodes directly. Well, at least, it is for me. If
it isn't for you -- I'm sorry. But I did try to take the analogy of a dynamic
PHP object, to which you can just add member variables, and extend that to
an object that could hold that data and represent that data in a standardised, 
yet flexible format to an entity to which it is not directly affiliated. If
you find the class useful and friendly, then great. If not, shake the dust 
from your feet and move along.

<p>
	I tend to do just about all of my coding in VIM. Actually, I stick to using
	the graphical version (GVIM), but sometimes make short trips to the land
	of the console. My reasons are simple: I need a uniform development 
	environment on win32 and linux (because I'm forced to use the first, and
	I love to use the second), and I needed something powerful, yet simple
	and, quite importantly, free. Not just free as in beer -- free as in
	licensing. I believe that the days of closed-source applications are
	over. Commercial apps can still be written: a coder has to eat and feed
	his wife and all that. But your clients deserve disclosure on the source, 
	should you be abducted by aliens or something similar. Or even just so they
	can also hire a hacker to implement features you didn't think of. But
	enough of that.</p>
	<p>Also, whilst VIM may give an initially steep learning curve, and
	seem to contain unnecessary keyboard work, you will find that other
	editors become annoying after you find the true power in vim. Also, very
	few other editors are as ready to adapt to the coder's wishes.</p>
	<p>The point is that you might notice a few commented out &lt;&lt;&lt;'s
	and corresponding &gt;&gt;&gt;'s. This is not an angle-bracket fetish: it's
	my choice for fold markers in vim (thanks to a friend) because curly braces
	cause problems in Tcl (even when commented), and tend to mess up the
	brace-matching for languages that use braces for code blocks, since
	vim cannot always tell what is a code brace, and what is a fold brace.
	You also might notice that I tend to stick to an 80 column line. This can
	make some sections of deep code a little short on space, but it's something
	I do as a matter of style (thanks to the same friend). It makes for
	easier reading on a terminal, and means that the code is more easily
	available to anyone who has time to waste on it.</p>

First, we have to examine some concepts that I was trying to encapsulate with
the class. In the typical scenario of a class, it has properties and methods. 
A class that was entirely data would more than likely not have any methods
to speak of, but just a lot of properties. And, possibly, child structures
containing data of their own. This is the model I worked on, and the cause
of the naming that I've used for the methods of the HD Object.
</p>
<p>First off, some rules: variables within the HD Object may not be preceeded
with a double underscore (__) -- I've reserved those kinds of names for
data internal to the HD Object, in the absence of true scoping of variables 
in php4. If php4 had the ability to declare variables as private, I would have
just stuck with that, but I had to adopt a hack rather. When php5 is available
in a stable format, I will more than likely update to conform to proper
scoping. In the meantime, at least the following reserved variables should
not be overwritten unless you know what you're doing:<br>
$__xml -- holds a string of the xml used to load the object<br>
$__doc -- reference to the xml document object<br>
$__root -- reference to the xml document's root element<br>
$__name -- root element's name (you can set this)<br>
$__mvars -- container of member variables<br>
$__childnames -- names of the children this object has<br>
$__attribs -- attributes on this object<br>
$__mvarattribs -- attributs on member variables for this object<br>
Others may be used in the future, so it would be best to just not use
member variables or children with names starting with __.
</p>
<p>On to the good stuff -- we could have gleaned from the information above
that we access member variables on the object, as we would for an object
created from a class that we hand-designed ourselves. Member variables can 
only have one value, and this may seem like a bit of a silly thing to say,
but we have to realise that an object may have more than one child with the
same name, since children are kept in an array. This means we can use the 
HD Object to transport tabular data, eg from a sql query. Neato! But we need
to have a look at usage to figure this all out...
</div>
<!-- >>> -->
<div class="shead">Usage</div>
<!-- <<< -->
<div class="section">
<p>
The best way to understand this is to just take a trip through some code. Let's
instantiate an hdobj:
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
$foo = new HDObj();
</pre></div>
Note that we could have instantiated with some XML to get an hdobj all loaded 
up for us automatically. But let's just start with something blank. Now, let's
add some member variables:
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
$foo-&gt;__name="MyFoo";
$foo-&gt;set_mvar("food", "burger");
$foo-&gt;set_mvar("color", "red");
$foo-&gt;set_mvar("bar", "quux");
$foo-&gt;set_mvar_attrib("bar", "order", 1);
</pre></div>
Which would give us a structure represented by the xml:
<pre>
&lt;MyFoo&gt;
	&lt;food&gt;burger&lt;/food&gt;
	&lt;color&gt;red&lt;/color&gt;
	&lt;bar order=&quot;1&quot;&gt;quux&lt;/bar&gt;
&lt;/MyFoo&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Neato. How about:
<div class="codeblock">
<pre>
$bar = new HDObj();
$bar->__name="MyBar";
$bar-&gt;set_mvar("bar", "Mybar's bar");
$bar-&gt;set_mvar_attrib("bar", "highlight", "0");
$foo-&gt;append_child($bar);
</pre>
</div>
which would give us something represented in XML by:
<pre>
&lt;MyFoo&gt;
	&lt;food&gt;burger&lt;/food&gt;
	&lt;color&gt;red&lt;/color&gt;
	&lt;bar order=&quot;1&quot;&gt;quux&lt;/bar&gt;
	&lt;MyBar&gt;
		&lt;bar highlight=&quot;0&quot;&gt;MyBar's bar&lt;bar&gt;
	&lt;/MyBar&gt;
&lt;/MyFoo&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>
To access the child Mybar from $foo, we would simply do, eg:
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
	print($foo-&gt;MyBar[0]-&gt;bar);
</pre></div>
Some notes about access:
<ul>
<li>Children and mvars are accessed by their node names -- as you would expect
from looking at an xml document, and wanting it to be represented by a data
object</li>
<li>Children are always accessed as elements of an array. So you could have
multiple Row children for a dataset object -- and access the data easily</li>
<li>The difference between an mvar and a child is simply that an mvar
contains some information, and a child contains other mvars. That's all there
is to it.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Now, of course, the real cool stuff comes from loading an hdobj with xml data
and using the data directly from the object, like so:
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
$foo = new HDObj(&quot;
&lt;dataset&gt;
	&lt;row rownum=&quot;0&quot;>
		&lt;id type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;14&lt;/id&gt;
		&lt;name type=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Bob Smith&lt;/name&gt;
		&lt;birthday type=&quot;date&quot;&gt;1964-08-23&lt;/birthday&gt;
	&lt;/row&gt;
	&lt;row rownum=&quot;1&quot;>
		&lt;id type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;16&lt;/id&gt;
		&lt;name type=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Ray Fincklestein&lt;/name&gt;
		&lt;birthday type=&quot;date&quot;&gt;1964-05-15&lt;/birthday&gt;
	&lt;/row&gt;
	&lt;row rownum=&quot;0&quot;>
		&lt;id type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;82&lt;/id&gt;
		&lt;name type=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Marie Otterburger&lt;/name&gt;
		&lt;birthday type=&quot;date&quot;&gt;1964-09-01&lt;/birthday&gt;
	&lt;/row&gt;
&lt;/dataset&gt;&quot;);
</pre>
</div>
Which may have been the result from a sql query, for instance<br><pre>
select id, name, birthday from users where birthday &gt; '1964-01-01' and birthday &lt; '1965-01-01';</pre>
to get a listing of all our users who were born in 1964. The nice part comes when we access that data:
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
print(&quot;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Birthday&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&quot;);
foreach ($foo-&gt;row as $row) {
	print(&quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;);
	print(&quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot;.$foo-&gt;name.&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;);
	print(&quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot;.$foo-&gt;birthday.&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;);
	print(&quot;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;);
}
print(&quot;&lt;/table&gt;&quot;);
</pre></div>
</p>
<p>
Obviously, you want to be able to set and retreive mvars, attributes and 
children. You've already seen how to set data, and how to retrieve member
variables, but what about attributes? What about convenience functions?
What else can this object do?
<ul>
<li>get_attribute($attribname, $default = "") returns the value of the named
attribute of the hdobj from which it is called, or the default value if that
attribute isn't set.
</li>
<li>get_mvar_attrib($mvar, $attribname, $default = "") does the same for a
member variable by the name of $mvar, on the hdobject from which it is called.
</li>
<li>create_child($name) creates a child for you -- no need to create another
hdobj, and append it
</li>
<li>parse($xml) loads the object from an xml string
</li>
<li>has_attrib($name); has_mvar($name) both return whether or not the named
item exists in the current object.
</li>
<li>child_count($childname = "") returns the number of children by the
specified name, or the number of all immediate children to the object.
</li>
<li>set_mvars_from_array($array) sets a whole bunch of mvars from a hash-like
array (what a timesaver!)
</li>
<li>list_childnames() / list_mvars() / list_attribs -- lists all names of objects children / mvars / attribs</li>
<li>load_from_array($array, $attribnames = array()) loads the object from
an array. The elements of the array may be other arrays -- which are then
loaded in as child elements. Elements of any array which can be found
by name in $attribnames are loaded as attributes on the relevant child
or mvar, instead of being processes as mvars.<br>
load_array_copy does the same as above, but copies the array first, meaning
that you can specify the array definition in the function call
</li>
<li>del_mvar($name); del_mvar_attrib($mvar, $name); del_attrib($name); 
del_child($name) -- deletes the specified item, if it exists</li>
<li>get_child($name, $idx) -- returns a reference to the specified child, if
it exists</li>
<li>sort_children($cname,$keyname,$asc_or_desc="asc",$attrib_or_mvar="",$defval="") -- sorts
children (named $cname) based on the values of mvar or attrib $keyname.
$attrib_or_mvar can be the string "attrib" or "mvar" to explicitly set
whether to sort by a named mvar or a named attribute -- or left blank to
auto-detect. $asc_or_desc is the sort order ("asc" or "desc").
$defval is the value to use when the attrib or mvar can't be
found.
</li>
<li>mvar_to_attrib($name); attrib_to_mvar($name) -- promotion / demotion 
(however you want to think of it) between attribute and mvar for a named
item (if it exists)</li>
<li>collapse_child($cname, $cindex) -- collapses the mvars and children of the
specified child into this object</li>
<li>append_xml($xml, $droproot = 1, $keep_root_attribs = 1) -- appends an xml
document onto this hdobject. Nice for merging xml documents. $droproot
determines whether or not the root element of the merged document is retained
-- since it's more often useful to merge in everything contained within the
root, but not the root itself, this option is defaulted on (and that's how
the demo script shows the option off), but you can set it off (try, and see
what happens in the demo). $keep_root_attribs determines whether or not the
attributes of the dropped root node are to be merged in with the new parent
node -- if so, only attributes that would not overwrite those of the new
parent are merged in.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>To get this object to dump out to XML, use the toXML() function, which can 
take 2 boolean arguments:
<ol>
<li>whether to normalise (indent children and mvars appropriately) -- makes 
the output more readable
</li>
<li>whether to make html safe for printing in an html document
</li>
</ol>
Both are set to false by default.
</p>
<p>Lastly, the clear() method (surprisingly) clears the object's data. And
the printout() method prints out the data in a format more like php's
var_dump format. Don't try to var_dump on the object -- circular references
abound due to the DOMIT usage, and you will just get a huge mess of text.
